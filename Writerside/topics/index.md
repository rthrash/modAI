# About modAI

A generative AI Extra for MODX Revolution 3.0 and later. It’s perfect for creating content quickly or speeding up optimizing SEO-related content including page titles, meta titles, meta descriptions, page summaries, and images/alt text (finally, an easy-button for Open Graph sharing images or hero sections).

The modAI Plugin adds a sparkle button (✦) next to fields or labels in back-end Manager for MODX Revolution. When clicked, it:

1. uses field-specific prompts for the type of content being created,
2. uses a supported AI model API to create said content, and
3. dumps the result directly into the appropriate field or a textarea that you can copy/paste from (e.g., for longer format articles going into the Content field). 

## Requirements

- MODX Revolution 3.x
- An API Key from your [Supported Provider](Supported-Providers.md)
- Pre-paid credits for API calls for ChatGPT if using—this is different from the $20/month ChatGPT Pro subscription

<note> 
    Image and vision support is currently only supported with the OpenAI and Gemini. Claude, Ollama and others only support text generation.
</note>

MODX’s modAI Extra works with the following Extras if installed:

- **[image+](https://extras.modx.com/package/imageplustvinput)** – for things like Open Graph sharing previews or hero section images with robust output templating, resizing, cropping and format conversions in conjunction with pThumb
- **[SEO Suite](https://extras.modx.com/package/seosuite)** – for managing and previewing SEO-related information for your sites
